## Code from Thursdays lesson in JavaScript

This lesson we learned about operator precedence, you can find the link to mozilla MDN in the resources repo. We also learned about template literals and how to concatinate strings
and numbers. We continued to learn about data types to be more specific type coersion and conversion i JavaScript and we also started to taking decisions in our code using if
